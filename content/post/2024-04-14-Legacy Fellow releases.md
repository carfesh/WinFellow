We sometimes get asked about older releases of Fellow for DOS as well as WinFellow, for a variety of reasons.
As many of these are no longer readily available in a convenient location, we have decided to publish a few here.
For this reason, a new History section has been established that you can visit in the menu at the top.
The history section is a work in progress, let us know if you notice any issues or factual mistakes within it.

We also would like to ask for help: we no longer have access to all of the older releases, and would like to be able
to preserve all of them for the future. If you have any Fellow versions that are listed as missing, it would be great
if you could [contact Torsten](mailto:torsten.enderling@gmail.com) so that we can make them available on the website
as well.

Thank you and have fun revisiting these earlier versions!
