      <description>There is a new public release of WinFellow v0.5.8 in the GitHub releases section; it had been published earlier as release candidate 1.
Compared to the earlier version 0.5.7, the following changes are included in this build:
New features
support for RDB hardfiles was implemented; while creating a new hardfile from the WinFellow GUI still creates &amp;ldquo;plain&amp;rdquo; hardfiles, a Rigid Disk Block can be created using tools like HD Toolbox the default naming scheme for filesystem devices has been changed from DHx: to FSx: to avoid naming conflicts with existing RDB hardfiles a 64 bit build is now provided; the NSIS installer will install either the 32 or 64 bit version depending on the operating system that is used Bug fixes</description>

      <description>New features:
re-designed display settings to make use of modern higher resolution displays more intuitive; instead of configuring a window resolution, scaling and overscan area can be configured automatically to create a window of the optimal size and scaling factor; both can also be configured manually to arrive at frequently window sizes support for the Direct3D 11 graphics API; this requires DirectX 11 to be installed on Windows Vista, the platform update KB971644 should be installed, as it contains required updates to DirectX the graphics card has to provide hardware acceleration for Direct3D ability to save screenshots to the pictures folder (hit &amp;lt; Print Screen &amp;gt; to trigger) support for automatic, as well as 3x and 4x scaling, which is useful for 4K/high DPI displays; for the best results, try leaving the scaling at automatic very basic serial port/UART emulation; nothing can be connected to the serial port; this is mostly used for serial debug logging (which is active only in debug builds of WinFellow), but the port is always being emulated Bug Fixes:</description>
